<h4>Introduction</h4>

<ul>
  <p>JavaScript was originally designed to make web pages "live". Programs in this language are called scripts. In the browser, they are connected directly to HTML and, as soon as the page loads, they are immediately executed.</p>
  <li>Compilation - is when the source code of a program, with the help of a special tool, another program called “compiler”, is converted into another language, as a rule - into machine code. This machine code is then distributed and started. In this case, the source code of the program remains with the developer.</li>
  <li>Interpretation - is when the source code of a program is received by another tool, which is called an “interpreter,” and executes it “as is”. At the same time, the source code itself (script) is distributed. This approach is used in browsers for javascript.</li>
