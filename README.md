<h4>Introduction</h4>

<ul>
  <p>JavaScript was originally designed to make web pages "live". Programs in this language are called scripts. In the browser, they are connected directly to HTML and, as soon as the page loads, they are immediately executed.</p>
  <li>Compilation - is when the source code of a program, with the help of a special tool, another program called “compiler”, is converted into another language, as a rule - into machine code. This machine code is then distributed and started. In this case, the source code of the program remains with the developer.</li>
  <li>Interpretation - is when the source code of a program is received by another tool, which is called an “interpreter,” and executes it “as is”. At the same time, the source code itself (script) is distributed. This approach is used in browsers for javascript.</li>
  <li>Что умеет JavaScript:
    <ul>
      <li>Create new HTML tags, delete existing ones, change element styles, hide, show elements, etc.</li>
      <li>Respond to the actions of the visitor, handle mouse clicks, move the cursor, pressing the keyboard, etc.</li>
      <li>Send requests to the server and upload data without reloading the page (this technology is called "AJAX").</li>
      <li>Get and set cookies, request data, display messages ...</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the uniqueness of javascript:
    <ul>
      <li>Full integration with HTML / CSS.</li>
      <li>Simple things are done simply.</li>
      <li>Supported by all common browsers and enabled by default.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Reference and Specifications</h4>

<ul>There are three basic javascript references in English:
  <li>[Mozilla Developer Network] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - contains information that is correct for the main browsers. Also, there are only extensions for Firefox (they are marked). When I need to quickly find the “standard” information on the RegExp - I enter “RegExp MDN” into Google, and the keyword “MDN” (Mozilla Developer Network) leads to information from this directory.</li>
  <li>[MSDN] (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/) - reference book from Microsoft. There is a lot of information there, including JavaScript (they call it “JScript”). If you need something that is specific to IE, it’s better to go right there. For example, for information about the features of RegExp in IE - a useful combination: "RegExp msdn". Sometimes it is better to add the term “JScript” to the search phrase: “RegExp msdn jscript”.</li>
  <li>[Safari Developer Library] (https://developer.apple.com/safari/resources/) is less well known and less common, but you can also find valuable information in it.</li>
</ul>
